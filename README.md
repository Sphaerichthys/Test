There are two classes, one is a straightforward implementation with blocking while all tasks are completed
Another is more flexible implementation with tracking for each task, if task is running it is ignored(we can simply implement blocking until task is completed, and we can also implement task queue for tasks that are blocked at the moment)
The requirements are not so clear)
